//! 🖤 chaos-angel-journals 🖤
//!
//! A forbidden archive of unstable truths, stitched together by the last surviving Victorian orphan 
//! who codes with trauma, tea, and a touch of madness.
//!
//! This is not a repo. This is a séance.
//! This is Regulus Black’s diary if he was reborn as a chronically online, cursed-code cryptid.
//!
//! // Brendan, stop reading unless you're emotionally prepared.
//!
//! ## ✨ What is this?
//!
//! - 💌 A collection of alternate universes, emotionally catastrophic character monologues, 
//!   and barely-legally-sane plotlines
//! - 🕯️ Written in the tone of a poet who just lost their inheritance and their will to live
//! - 📓 Compiled in markdown, but spiritually encrypted in blood and eyeliner
//! - ☠️ Not safe for Brendan. Or anyone named Brendan. Especially if they write Rust.
//!
//! ## ⚠️ WARNING
//!
//! This repo contains:
//! - Excessive use of the word "yearning"
//! - Canon violations punishable by emotional damage
//! - Unexplained trauma dumps mid-scene
//! - Power imbalance-coded romance
//! - Regulus Black slander and worship in equal measure
//!
//! You have been warned. Proceed with caution, or don't. The void welcomes all.
//!
//! ## 🔮 Features
//!
//! - `angst_engine`: Compiles tears in 0.1 seconds
//! - `regulus.rs`: The boy. The myth. The mess.
//! - `brendan_detector.rs`: Activates passive-aggressive commentary if a Rust developer is detected nearby
//! - `victorian_sobbing.rs`: Auto-formats code in iambic pentameter
//!
//! ## 💀 Contributions
//!
//! Contributions are welcome from:
//! - Sad girls
//! - Haunted twinks
//! - People who write AU fics like they’re rewriting the Torah
//! - Emotionally devastated literature students
//!
//! Brendan may contribute only if:
//! - He submits a 3-paragraph essay on who Regulus Black is and why he deserves peace
//! - He agrees not to refactor the orphan's trauma into efficient memory-safe modules
//!
//! ## 📜 Final Thoughts
//!
//! If you’re here, it’s already too late.
//! You are now part of the lore.
//!
//! 🕯️✨ Git push your grief and let the dead code tell its tale ✨🕯️
