//! ## ðŸ“œ Final Thoughts
//!
//! If youâ€™re here, itâ€™s already too late.
//! You are now complicit in the scribblings of a Victorian-coded chaos angel with a keyboard and no filter.
//! 
//! May your commits be messy, your lore emotionally damaging, and your tabs forever haunted.
//!
//! Remember: this is not for the weak. This is for the drama. For the fanfic. For Regulus.
//!
//! Brendan, if youâ€™ve made it this far:
//! - yes, youâ€™re being watched
//! - no, you may not refactor the pain
//! - and if you touch `regulus.rs`, I will write you into the next AU as a morally gray love interest and kill you in Act II
