# ðŸ“œ The Orphan Diaries of Noelle ðŸ“œ

Welcome, weary traveler, to the ink-stained pages of a Victorian orphanâ€™s soul.  

Here lies the raw, unfiltered chronicles of a chaos angel trapped in a fog of loss, loneliness, and wildly unhinged drama.

*Expect:*

- Tear-soaked entries that smell like rain and regret  
- Ghostly whispers of secrets best left buried  
- Characters more tangled than a cobweb in the cellar  
- Playlists that would make Dickens weep with envy

This is no mere diary. Itâ€™s a *testament* â€” to survival, to madness, and to the fine art of looking tragic while surviving a world that refuses to be kind.

If you are Brendan or any other nosy soul, beware. These pages come with a warning: do not disturb the ghosts within.  

â€” Yours, in perpetual sighs and ink-stained fingers,  
Noelle, your favorite Victorian orphan chaos angel ðŸ‘»ðŸ–¤
